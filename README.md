# 🩺 Tumor Classification: Benign or Malignant 🩺

Welcome to this project! Here, we classify tumors as **benign** or **malignant** using **Decision Trees** and clinical data from the `scikit-learn` breast cancer dataset. 🧬 Our goal is to train, visualize, and evaluate a decision tree classifier for precise tumor diagnosis. 🌳

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📂 Prerequisites
Make sure you have:
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Libraries** like `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`

### 📦 Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

We’re working with a breast cancer dataset that includes:
- **30 Features** (like radius, texture, perimeter, and area)
- **Target Variable**: `0` for benign, `1` for malignant

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We perform data exploration to understand feature relationships and their impact on tumor classification. A heatmap will help visualize correlations across features. 📊

---

## 🛠️ Data Preparation

### 🔑 Feature Selection
We focus on key features that are most correlated with tumor malignancy to train our model more effectively.

### ⚙️ Data Scaling
Features are standardized to improve model performance, ensuring each feature contributes equally.

### 📏 Data Split
The data is split into training and testing sets to validate model accuracy.

## 🌲 Decision Tree Classifier

Using a **Decision Tree Classifier**, we build a model that classifies tumors with high accuracy. This is followed by:

- 🎯 Model Evaluation: Confusion matrix and classification report to understand accuracy.
- 🖼️ Visualization: A graphical representation of the decision tree for easy interpretation.

---

## 📈 Decision Tree Regression (Experimental)

We also explore **Decision Tree Regression** on specific features for a comparative analysis of benign and malignant predictions.

---

## 📊 Results and Visualizations

Our visualizations and results provide a clear understanding of feature importance and classification accuracy. 🎉
